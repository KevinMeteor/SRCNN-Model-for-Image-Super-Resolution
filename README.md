# SRCNN-Model-for-Image-Super-Resolution
This is a deep learning project applying the SRCNN model, proposed in the paper ['Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks,'](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092) and implemented with the PyTorch library.

## Installation 
If your device with CUDA and its version is greater than v11.8, you can consider creating a conda environment for all the dependencies by
```
conda env create --file torch_118.yaml --name torch_118
```


## My Hardware Specs
```
Intel Core i7-12700 CPU 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3080 (32GB)
32GB DDR4 RAM
